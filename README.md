This project was made by learning Xamarin Forms and see how it interacts with other layers of the application.
When I started learning Xamarin development, I couldn't find sample projects in MVVM architecture. So I searched through web and developed my own. I posted this so that this project might be helpl those people who started learning xamarin Forms. I'm  still learning. This project is merely my attempt to put something together based on the learning put across youtube and Udemy couses and in the official Microsoft documentation.

## Platforms
This project will run in Windows ,iOS and Android.

## Architecture
The Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern helps to cleanly separate the business and presentation logic of an application from its user interface (UI). Maintaining a clean separation between application logic and the UI helps to address numerous development issues and can make an application easier to test, maintain, and evolve. It can also greatly improve code re-use opportunities and allows developers and UI designers to more easily collaborate when developing their respective parts of an app.
There are three core components in the MVVM pattern: the model, the view, and the view model. Each serves a distinct purpose.
